This is my submission to the Telstra competition on Kaggle.

The goal of the project is to develop a model that correctly prediction network service disruption level.

The project covers:

1)  data cleaning and manipulation
2)  one hot encoding for categorical data
3)  pca for dimensionality reduction
4)  Logistic Regression, RandomForest, AdaBoost, LDA, and QDA ML classifier models in Scikit-learn
5)  grid search, k-fold cross validation, validation curves, and learning curves for model tuning and assessment
